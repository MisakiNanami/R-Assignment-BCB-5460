This is the repository for my R assignment. The R markdown file used to generate the associated files is named analysis_code.rmd and the output file is analysis_code.pdf. 

The associated data files for maize and teosinte are kept in their corresponding folder with "increasing" and "decreasing" subfolders for the different ordering of the output files.
