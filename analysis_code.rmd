# R Assignment

## Data Inspection

### Attributes of `fang_et_al_genotypes`

I ran the following code to analyze the fang_et_al_genotypes.txt file.

```{R}
# Loaded needed libraries
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)

# Saved file data as a dataframe
file_path <- "fang_et_al_genotypes.txt"
raw_data <- read_delim(file_path, delim="\t")

# I checked how large the file size is in MB
file_size <- file.info(file_path)[1,1]/1000000
print(file_size)

# I inspected the data frame dimensions
dim(raw_data)

# I checked the first few and last few lines of the file
head(raw_data)
tail(raw_data)

# I checked the file encoding using the unix command
command <- sprintf("file %s",file_path)
system(command)


```
